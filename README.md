# Next.js Performance Showcase

This project demonstrates various performance optimization techniques in Next.js.

## Features Demonstrated

### âœ… Code Splitting
- **Dynamic imports** for heavy components (Chart.js, Leaflet, WaveSurfer.js)
- **Lazy loading** with React.lazy and Suspense
- **Bundle optimization** to reduce initial page load

### âœ… Streaming
- **Basic streaming** with skeleton loading states
- **Dashboard streaming** with staggered component loading
- **Nested streaming** with progressive content rendering
- **Multiple loading patterns** (skeleton, spinner, placeholder)

### ðŸš§ Coming Soon
- And more performance techniques...

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
